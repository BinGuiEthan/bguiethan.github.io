                One day I was on the road and saw a Tesla. It is so coolï¼ŒI was attracted by his seagull door. <br>
                A handsome guy in the car, looks very friendly. I asked him where I can buy it. I bought this <br>
                car that night. I was so happy. I drove home when I drove, but when I was about to arrive home,<br>
                 I woke up. One day, this will be achieved.
